#100 Days of Code - Log
<h2>Day 1 January 19, 2017</h2>
<b>Today's Progress:</b> 
Starting from the basics to gain coding discipline.
Worked on the HTML5/CSS section on FreeCodeCamp from the beggining, ended my session on "Link to external pages with anchor elements"

<b>Thoughts:</b>While simple, still a much needed review.

<b>Today's Progress:</b>
Finished the html/css section on FreeCodeCamp.

<b>Thoughts:</b> Need to start getting into the routine of using a whiteboard to practice writting code, and not just copy/pasting to run through it.

There is no formation without repetition. I'm sure I'm going to come back to these exercises once I start building some websites.
